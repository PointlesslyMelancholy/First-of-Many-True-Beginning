# First-of-Many-True-Beginning
A basic text based game, very easy to navigate I'd say. This is just a mark on my progress on learning how to code.
This game is the result of two weeks of learning some coding from a Youtube vid. There's many endings and a secret one if you pay attention to some out of place letters,
I'd like some thoughts on it, whether negative, positive or neutral criticism. I'll continue to do more as I keep learning how to code.
Thanks.
